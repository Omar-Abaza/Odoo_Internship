    DATA TYPES:
    
    1 - Numeric Types 
        it contains :
        1 - integers   
            ex => 15
            
        2 - Floating
            ex => 1.5
            
        3 - complex
            ex => 15+2j
            
=============================================================

    2 - Boolean 
        it contains 
        1 - True
            ex => returns 1 or true for true situations
            
        2 - False
            ex => returns 0 or false for false situations
            
=============================================================

    3 - Text Type
        it contains 
        1 - string 
            ex => "Hi I am string"
            
            * a script between single or double brackets
        
=============================================================

    4 - Set Types
        it contains 
        1 - set 
            ex => {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
        
            * Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            * A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
            * Sets are written with curly brackets.


=============================================================

    5 - Sequence Types
        it contains 
        1 - list
            ex => ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            
            * Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            * List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
            * Lists are created using square brackets.

        2 - tuple 
            ex => ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
            * Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            * A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
            * Tuples are written with round brackets.
            
        3 - range
            ex => range(6)
        
        
    
""")
